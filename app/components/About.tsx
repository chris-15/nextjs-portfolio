        <p>Hi, I&apos;m Chris ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p className=" tracking-wide">
          I am full stack developer with a background in Mechanical Engineering
          and experience in the aerospace industry, passionate about creating
          innovative solutions to complex problems and pushing the boundaries of
          what is possible with technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve always been drawn to technology and my interest in computers led
          me to coding, and I decided to transition into Software Engineering.
          In 2022, I enrolled in the University of Connecticut's Coding
          Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p className="tracking-wide">
          The intensive program helped me develop a diverse skill set and deepen
          my passion for coding. Now, as a Full Stack Developer, I&apos;m eager to
          apply my problem-solving skills and attention to detail to make a
          meaningful impact in the software engineering industry. I&apos;m actively
          seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative projects.
