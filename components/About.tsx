          <p>Hi, I&apos;m Chris ðŸ‘‹</p>
          <p className="tracking-wider">
            I am front-end web developer with a background in Mechanical
            Engineering and experience in the aerospace industry, passionate
            about creating innovative solutions to complex problems and pushing
            the boundaries of what is possible with technology.
          </p>
          <p className="tracking-wider">
            I&apos;ve always been drawn to technology and my interest in
            computers led me to coding, and I decided to transition into
            Software Engineering. In 2022, I enrolled in the University of
            Connecticut&apos;s Coding Bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p className="tracking-wider">
            The intensive program helped me develop a diverse skill set and
            deepen my passion for coding. Now, as a Front-End Web Developer,
            I&apos;m eager to apply my problem-solving skills and attention to
            detail to make a meaningful impact in the software engineering
            industry. I&apos;m actively seeking opportunities to contribute to
            innovative projects.
